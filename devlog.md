The Experience Experience

==== An Interactive Mini Search Engine ====
( Learning Web Scraping )

**== The Goal ==**

-- ask for input
-- use web scraping to:
    -- get a sound file and play it
    -- get an image and display it
    -- get a paragraph and print it

- 1:

- set up the venv

- Tried to get audio and images from Pixabay,
  and text from Wikipedia, but Pixabay has an error 403
  not allowed 

- 2:

- Wikipedia has images, too! so I'll use those; and
  I'm using Freesound for the audio now, along with a regex to get all links to mp3 files.

- Trying to get mp3 binary data from mp3 link, unsuccessful for now.

- 1:

- tried to get it to work, no success. probably a pip problem.
- maybe I can turn it around, into an idea I had.

- basically get some text, do the markov stuff, and have a tts read it.
- the text COULD be from Wikipedia

- I made Schaolar v1! it uses an api (always use if possible!) to get text from wikipedia.

- It is actually pretty neat already. Mom wants different avatars besides lego bot,
- and probably different voices. Maybe add images and/or lorem-ipsum sprinklerine
- markov stuff.

- 2:

- added more schaolars and voices; and maybe soon have an image displayed side-by-side
- if ipywidgets will work.

- later:

- added more schaolars, and voices to match.
- THIS IS SO FUNNY -- project success
